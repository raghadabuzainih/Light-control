A simple interactive light control system built with React.  
The app allows users to toggle lights on and off when clicking on it.

- Each light is represented as an object in an array (`pads.js`)
- Clicking a light toggles its state to "on" (bright or high opacity using css) or "off" (dim or low opacity)
- Built using two components: `App` (main logic) and `Pad` (individual light unit)
- Demonstrates usage of `props` and `useState` for component interaction
